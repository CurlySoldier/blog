# 📝 Personal Blogging Website – Project Plan

A minimalist blog to explore emerging technologies, personal development, and project learnings — written in my own voice, hosted on GitHub Pages, and iteratively developed with clarity, authenticity, and simplicity.

---

## ✅ Project Intent

- Serve as a personal memory bank and thought archive
- Offer honest, thoughtful reflections for others navigating similar paths
- Build without elaborate frameworks, using Markdown + Jekyll
- Maintain full authorship — AI will not write posts
- Use GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- Evolve the design slowly over time — minimal but extensible

---

## 🔑 Core Values

- **Authenticity** – My words, my tone, no automated writing
- **Clarity** – Simple, clean content presentation
- **Thoughtfulness** – Reflective, personal, and vulnerable writing
- **Approachability** – No jargon-heavy or overly formal tone
- **Simplicity** – Lightweight, easy to maintain, easy to iterate

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Policy

### AI *Can* Help With:
- Project planning and structure
- CI/CD workflow setup (non-writing code)
- Design and layout suggestions
- Post outline brainstorming (not content generation)
- Feedback on clarity (only when invited)

### AI *Will Not*:
- Write or rewrite blog posts
- Create tone, style, or structure of your writing
- Replace your reflection, vulnerability, or insight

> **Philosophy:** I create the meaning. AI helps me hold the shape.
