## 🎉 The Big Picture

This approach prioritizes **learning over perfection**. You'll have a working blog quickly, then gradually understand how everything works. This prevents the common trap of spending weeks configuring tools instead of writing content.

**Remember**: The goal is to support your writing habit, not to become a Jekyll expert. If Jekyll becomes a barrier to writing, we can always pivot to something simpler.
